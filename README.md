# Offer1 Interview Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to give you a quick starting place for the exercise. You can use the provided code or use a different framework/language for the front-end. You will need to provide all code for the back-end using which ever framework/language you are most comfortable with.

## Exercise Description

Image that you have been hired to create a new Real Estate application to help consumers purchase a home. Your new company is up against the a tight timeline and needs to deliver a minimum viable product (mvp) ASAP! In order to compete in the market place your MVP should provide the following core functionality:

- View/browse all available homes
- Filter homes by City, Price, Number of Bedrooms
- Show detailed view for a selected home

## Solution Details

Create a detailed web app that solves for the following:

- modularity
- appropriate handling of flow/navigation
- appropirate handling of data/state

A sample [data set](./src/homes.json) representing properties has been included to help get you started on what a data model and API call would likely return for the list of active properties. Your solution should include frontend and backend code that solves for the above requirements.

## Submitting the Exercise

1. Ensure that the scripts needed to run your solution/app are all working and documented. They must all run successfully.

2. Please make sure the repo is public. If you prefer to keep your repo private, then ensure you have granted read access to [tonyhernandez](https://github.com/tonyhernandez).

3. Completed the Google Form [here](https://forms.gle/We7VGi73apbECGKL6) once you are done with the code. Once submitted do not make any further changes to the code!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- Note that this is a development server and has only been tested to be working on Node v16. Node v17+ WILL BREAK THE APP. Please use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to manage your Node version as appropriate.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
